"Create a music streaming app called Vintify using the Svelte framework. The app should feature the following functionalities:

1. User Authentication:

Implement Login and Registration pages using Firebase Authentication or any other authentication service.

Use simple form validations (e.g., required fields, valid email format) and provide error messages for incorrect inputs.

Allow users to reset password via email.

2. Music Streaming:

Implement a Music Player that allows users to play, pause, skip, and adjust the volume of tracks.

Display information about the currently playing track (e.g., song name, artist, album art).

Implement a progress bar to show the current position of the track being played.

Allow users to view the playlist (dynamic list of songs) during playback.

Allow users to shuffle and repeat the songs in the playlist.

3. Upload Own Music:

Allow users to upload their own songs (MP3 format or other common audio formats) to the platform through a drag-and-drop interface or file picker.

Implement Firebase Storage (or other cloud storage solutions) to securely store the uploaded songs.

After uploading, users can give a title to the song, add a description, and tag the genre.

Once uploaded, the song should be displayed in the user's profile or music library with album art, title, and artist information.

Provide users the option to edit or delete their uploaded songs.

Implement file validation to ensure only supported audio formats (e.g., MP3, WAV) are uploaded.

4. Song and Playlist Display:

Show uploaded songs in a dedicated "My Music" or "Library" section.

Display each song’s album cover (or default cover), song name, artist, and playback controls.

Allow users to listen to songs uploaded by others or the songs they’ve uploaded themselves.

Display the most popular tracks based on play count, likes, or user ratings.

Implement dynamic playlist generation, where users can create personalized playlists from their uploaded songs or public tracks.

5. Search Functionality:

Allow users to search for songs, albums, and artists, including both uploaded tracks and general tracks (from public library).

Display relevant results dynamically as the user types, with the ability to filter by genre, popularity, or artist.

6. Dark Theme Interface:

Design the UI with a dark theme, using white text and vibrant accent colors (e.g., orange).

The layout should be clean, modern, and minimalistic.

Use Svelte for reactive components to make the app feel fast and responsive.

7. Additional Features (Optional):

Users should be able to create, edit, and delete playlists, where they can add both uploaded and public songs.

Implement like buttons, comment sections, and sharing options so users can interact with each other.

Add a rating system where users can rate songs, giving feedback on the music.

Allow users to follow other users, and view their uploaded songs or playlists.

Allow users to share their playlists or songs via social media or direct links.

8. File Handling and Security:

Ensure that the uploaded files (MP3s) are securely stored in a cloud storage service like Firebase Storage or Amazon S3.

Implement file validation on the server-side to check the file type (MP3, WAV, etc.), and size (limit upload size).

Set up security rules to allow users to access only their own uploaded files, ensuring that users cannot modify or download other users' content.

Implement streaming security to prevent unauthorized download of the uploaded songs.

9. Tech Stack Suggestions:

Frontend: Svelte (or SvelteKit) for fast, reactive components; Tailwind CSS for styling; Howler.js for managing audio playback.

Backend/Storage: Firebase Storage for securely storing music files; Firebase Authentication for user login and registration; Firebase Firestore for storing metadata about songs, users, and playlists.

Database: Firebase Firestore (or another NoSQL database) to store metadata such as title, artist, genre, descriptions, etc.

Audio Streaming: Use HTML5 Audio API or Howler.js for streaming MP3 files efficiently.

Cloud Functions (Optional): To handle file validation, background tasks like audio processing, and more.

Key Additions and Updates:

Password Reset for user authentication.

Playlist Management (create, edit, delete) as part of the optional features.

Song Editing and Validation for uploads.

File Handling and Streaming Security to make sure only authorized users can access their own content.

Follow Users and social interaction features, like liking, commenting, and sharing.

Expanded Search Functionality to cover filters for better music discovery.
